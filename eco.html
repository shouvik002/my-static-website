                Eco-Tourism Park in Kolkata is an expansive urban park designed to promote eco-tourism in the city. It is the biggest urban park in India and occupies over 475 acres of land. The beauty of the location increases ten folds because of a water body that surrounds the park and forms an island in the middle. It is often visited by picnickers or those who want a quick escape from mundane lives. The beautiful and well-maintained landscape is a perfect retreat for nature lovers. All the facilities provided inside the park are designed to decrease the adverse effects on nature through non-pollution and preservation of the natural landscape.
            <p>The idea of an Eco-Tourism Park in Kolkata was proposed by Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of the state of West Bengal. HIDCO - Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation of West Bengal coordinated with several departments and brought about the construction of the Eco-Tourism Park in Kolkata. It has three major parts - the ecological zones, the gardens and the recreational zones making it a perfect getaway to relax and unwind. They have some activities that visitors can choose from to suit their requirement. They also have cottages and conference halls that can be rented for personal or business needs. The Eco Park is a beautiful respite from the developing concrete jungle in the city.
