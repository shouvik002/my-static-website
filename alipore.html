                Zoological Garden or Zoo in Kolkata is one of the prime tourist spots in the city. The Alipore Zoological Garden first opened its gate on the 1st of May, 1876 and since then has remained an absolute favorite of children. The history of Alipore Zoo Garden dates back to as early as 1842, when the curator of Bengal Asiatic Society, Dr John McCleland came up with a plan for the establishment of the zoological garden in Calcutta. However, this did not materialize and was followed by the plan of Dr. Joseph Bart Fayrer (the president of Asiatic Society of Bengal) in 1867. This plan drew great public attention but failed due to a lack of space. For the same reason the plan of Carl Louise Schwendler, the postmaster to the Govt. of India failed in 1873. At last, in 1875 the Lt. Govt. of Bengal Sir Richard Temple took the initiative. The land on Alipore Road was chosen and approved leading to opening gates to the public on 1st May, 1876.

                It spreads on an area of 18.11 hectares and particularly is a favourite for Children and their family. There are many animals, reptiles, primates and birds at the Zoological Garden Kolkata. However, the most popular ones are the Bengal Tiger, White Tiger, African Lion, Giraffe, Zebra, Galapagos Giant Tortoise, Pelican, Pheasant, etc. It is also home to one of the few captive breeding projects involving the Manipur brow-antlered Deer. The zoo sports a large collection of attractive birds, including some threatened species - large parrots including a number of macaw species, conures, lories and lorikeets; other large birds like turacos and hornbills; colourful game birds like the golden pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant and Swinhoe's pheasant and some large flightless Birds like the emu, cassowary and ostrich.
