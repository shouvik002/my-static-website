                The Race Course was built in 1820 under the Imperial British Administration. Horse Polo being a favorite pastime sport of the British, had therefore naturally found its way into our land. Calcutta (Kolkata) at that time was one of the central seats of British Administration. As the British ruled our land then, they incorporated many of their westernized influences on the city. Apart from being known for their cruelty on the Indians; they were also known to have some developed sense of several amusement and sports which they brought into the city. They organized an elite club known as the Royal Calcutta Turf Club, which looked after the gaming events of the Race Course. Some prestigious races started by them were the Queen Elizabeth Cup & the Calcutta Derby Cup. Many other important and prestigious racing events were also held there from time to time. Apart from horse races, the ground was also used for playing polo.
