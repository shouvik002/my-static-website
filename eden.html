                The Gardens came into being when the Governor General Lord Auckland desired to create a circus and a garden. A pleasure ground with an oblong tank in center was laid out on this site generally for recreation activities. The site was initially named Auckland Circus Gardens. The adjacent Eden Gardens Stadium is the largest cricket stadium in India and the second largest in the world according to its seating capacity. The historic and iconic cricket stadium has a seating capacity of more than one lakh spectators. It was one of the first cricket stadiums in India where floodlights were installed and Day-Night cricket was played. The gigantic electronic scoreboard is also one of its kind in the country. The stadium has had the privilege of hosting the most important cricket matches like World Cup Finals of 1987, World Cup Semi Finals of 1996, Hero Cup and many other tournaments both national and international.
              <p>It is the home of the Bengal Cricket Team and the Kolkata Knight Riders of the Indian Premier League, as well as being a venue for Test, One Day International and Twenty 20 International matches. Nevertheless, it remains the third biggest cricket stadium in the world, trailing Melbourne Cricket Ground and ANZ Stadium in Australia. As the saying goes in the world of cricket that a cricketer's cricketing education is not complete till he has played in front of a packed Eden Gardens.
