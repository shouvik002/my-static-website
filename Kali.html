                Dakshineswar Kali temple is one of the holiest places of Eastern India. It is one of the must visit places in Kolkata. Dakshineswar is a Hindu temple located in Dakshineswar near Kolkata. Situated on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the presiding deity of the temple is Bhavatarini. The temple was built by Rani Rashmoni, a philanthropist and a devotee of Kali in 1855. The temple is famous for its association with Ramakrishna, a mystic of 19th century Bengal. The temple compound, apart from the nine-spired main temple, contains a large courtyard surrounding the temple, with rooms along the boundary walls. There are twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva (Kalis companion) along the riverfront, a temple to Radha-Krishna, a bathing ghat on the river and a shrine dedicated to Rani Rashmoni. Nahavat-Khana, the chamber in the northwestern corner just beyond the last of the Shiva temples, is where Ramakrishna spent a considerable part of his life.
               <p> In the early 1800s, Dakshineswar was a small village along the eastern banks of River Ganga. Dense forests surrounded the area where the famous Dakshineswar temple stands today. It was 300 years back when Durgaprasad Roy Choudhury and Bhavaniprasad Roy Choudhury, members of the renowned Savarna Roy Choudhury family settled here. Yogindranath, one of the successors of this family, was an ardent devotee of Sri Ramakrishna who later was known as Swami Yogananda.
               <p>The famous Dakshineswar temple which houses Goddess Kali was founded by Rani Rashmoni following a dream she saw when she was about to embark on her pilgrimage to Benaras. A long term plan of the Rani materialized which she had longed to perform when her husband died with the unfulfilled wish of constructing a Kali temple. The idols of the Gods and the Goddess were decided to be installed on the snana-yatra day, an auspicious day for the Hindus. On 31st May 1855, more than 1 lakh Brahmins were invited from different parts of the country to grace the auspicious occasion amidst the controversy of the Rani being in no position to own a temple and to offer Brahmins to feed since she was of low birth. The Rani lived only for five years and nine months after the inauguration of the temple. She seriously fell ill in 1861. Realizing that death was approaching she decided to handover the property (which she purchased in Dinajpur (now in Bangladesh) as a legacy). For the maintenance of the temple to the temple trust she accomplished her task on 18th February, 1861 and passed away on the subsequent day.</p>

                It is well connected to Kolkata. Vivekananda Setu across the Hooghly River at Dakshineswar connects it to Bally, Uttarpara and Dankuni on the other bank and on to Grand Trunk Road, Delhi Road, Bombay Road and Durgapur Expressway. A new bridge named 'Nivedita Setu' has been built to ease out the load of old bridge, 'Vivekanada Setu'. There are many buses from Kolkata, as well from places across the river are there to reach Dakhineswar.
